# Notes

## Week ending 2023-12-30

- Finished region.jl, quite proud. Will be used for addatoms.jl.
- Changed name to JMD (Jacobs Molecular Dynamics)
- Will need to separate conditions into integrators and other conditions b/c
    some thermostats (e.g., Nose-Hoover) alter equations of motion, while others
    (e.g., Langevin) do not.
- Investigate Brownian, Newtonian, Nose-Hoover, Langevin eqs of motion
- Later: Populate needsreneighbor and reneighbor! functions.
